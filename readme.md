## Requirements

This work was made using Visual Code (1.22.2) in a Anaconda (1.8.3) environment. Bellow there are a list of libraries and files required to run the code.

### Libraries

### Files

Right now they are hardcoded and needs to have the exact leght.

* `dataset/david/`
    * david_1.mp4
    * david_2.mp4
    * david_3.mp4



## How to run the code

Make sure to have the right versions of the tools listed in the [requirements](#requirements), and all the files listed in [files](#Files).

Open a terminal in the project directory and run the following code:
